Euler
=====

Solutions to Project Euler problems. Mostly in Python, and probably not the fastest or most elegant solutions.
Note: Problems 1-5 were really easy, mostly one-liners (or prime factorization for #5), so I have not included them here.
...really though, I just can't find the flashdrive that I backed them up on
